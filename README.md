## How to build it yourself!

What you'll need:
- Windows OS
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- SDL latest release

Hopefully you are already using Windows. If not, come back when you have a Windows PC. Getting Microsoft Visual Studio is simple. Go to: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and download **"Visual Studio"**. Do not download "Visual Studio Code". To acquire the latest release of SDL go to: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases and in the **"Assets"** dropdown download SDL2-x.xx.x.zip.
